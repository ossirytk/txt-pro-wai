1
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:47,155
Cancel the Twenty-one Demands!

2
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:52,250
Give back Qingdao! We swear on our lives!

3
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,277
Democracy.

4
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,193
Science.

5
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:54,209
Wing Chun Martial Arts School

6
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,676
Mr. Ip Master Chan

7
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,897
Please come in OK

8
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,586
Finish the lesson for me

9
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:13,883
Yes, Master. How are you, Mr. Ip?

10
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,800
Girl's stuff, no substance

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,373
Watch your mouth, Man!

12
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,904
Master Ng Mui created this Wing Chun fist style,

13
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,853
the secret is the control of power with flexibility

14
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,698
It's my honour and pleasure to see

15
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,002
this fine class of disciples you have, Master Chan

16
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,802
Mr. Ip, I've heard that you're travelling between
Hong Kong and Foshan

17
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,107
Business must be doing well, then

18
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,792
Oh, before I forget, I must pay you the rent

19
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,554
No hurry, no hurry. We're good friends!

20
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,549
You rent Mulberry Garden to me at such a low
rent;

21
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,659
I have not yet found an opportunity

22
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,421
Seriously, it won't be hard to pay back the favor,
if you wish

23
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,795
Man!

24
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:50,328
Yes, Dad!

25
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:54,285
This is my youngest son, lp Man,

26
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,088
my own flesh and blood

27
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,921
Tin Chi! Dad!

28
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,341
This is my adopted son who has been with us for
a year now,

29
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,297
Tin Chi

30
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,673
The purpose of my trip here today is to get them
a superb master

31
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,016
A master?

32
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,616
Yes! They both have a passion for Kung Fu

33
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,835
Please accept this tea to show my commitment,
Master

34
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,354
Please accept the tea, Master

35
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,792
As members of our school,

36
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,634
you two must observe the guiding principles

37
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,130
Martial arts learning - genuine and authentic;

38
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,048
behavior - proper and discrete;

39
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,199
judgement - objective and rational

40
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,037
Understood, Master

41
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,413
Didn't you say that you love Kung Fu, Man?

42
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,255
Many other disciples will keep you company.

43
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,518
I have to go to Hong Kong on business

44
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:55,387
Dad, take good care of yourself!

45
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,801
Make sure you look after your little brother, Tin
Chi

46
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,168
Dad, I will, I promise

47
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,627
Dad!

48
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,391
Time to take the medicine, Master

49
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,071
Leave it there!

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,787
Remember! All hand movements are clearly
directed by the intention in mind;

51
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,853
if your intention is justified, you're on the right
track

52
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:42,923
Master, the medicine is getting cold

53
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,511
You have shown improvement

54
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:32,984
Remember! The noble mind commands authentic
style- movements,

55
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,670
which allow stability when you defend, and
invincibility when you attack

56
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,624
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's
shadow, not his hand.

57
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:41,577
Focus on what you feel rather than what you see.
Understand?

58
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,683
Yes, Master

59
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,789
Maintain world peace;

60
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,934
establish the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity
Sphere

61
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,543
You are the hope of our Empire,

62
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,461
Japan's future rests with you

63
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:16,602
Dad...

64
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,049
Tin Chi, wake up! Are you having a bad dream?

65
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:23,238
What... were... you saying?

66
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,871
Are you hungry? In fact, I'm hungry, too

67
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,778
There's nothing to eat at all

68
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:54,733
Look! Two huge rats coming out to find
something to eat!

69
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,265
You'll be dead if the master finds out

70
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,221
Not him, it's me

71
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:02,214
It's... me... not him

72
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,093
Hush!

73
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,932
Since you gave me a toffee,

74
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,350
I'll help you out!

75
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,799
This is for you

76
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,909
Why do fried double-sticks only come in pairs?

77
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,516
How nice if there were three pieces

78
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,654
Drink this one, Master

79
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,258
This bowl is freshly made

80
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:45,754
You're so busy

81
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,893
The medicine won't be as effective if it's reheated

82
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:53,119
Chung So, you are dedicated and dutiful,

83
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,071
I'll be happy to see you inherit this school

84
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,715
Man is gifted in martial arts

85
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:04,392
Give him the best after I'm gone.

86
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,762
Yes!

87
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:10,994
Go watch them!

88
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:26,571
Master! Master!

89
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,752
Stay away, stay clear.

90
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:47,046
Have a smooth voyage, Master! Give us your
blessing

91
00:09:57,452 --> 00:10:00,828
The sun is setting, clear of obstruction and ill luck

92
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,780
Raise the casket

93
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,186
Lower the casket

94
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:25,302
This is my promise and my oath to Master Wah
Shun:

95
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:28,371
I, Chung So, will exert all energy, with all my
might,

96
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:31,852
to make authentic Wing Chun prosper for as long
as I live

97
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,811
1, 2, 3, 4

98
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,803
palms up, strike, withdraw, reach out, strike

99
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:42,640
1, 2, 3, 4, palms up, strike

100
00:10:51,311 --> 00:11:07,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

101
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,800
Withdraw

102
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,174
All right! That's it for the day.

103
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,705
Go home

104
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,379
Tin Chi, you were quite good today

105
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,949
Take a rest, Man!

106
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,366
Hey! Listen to Brother Chung So. Let's eat!

107
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,747
Mei Wai, let me help you set the table

108
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:31,892
Good!

109
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,998
Rest! Dinner's ready

110
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,295
All right!

111
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,858
Spend the Lantern Festival with sweets

112
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,275
Enjoy sweet dumplings together

113
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,040
Tin Chi, how lucky we are!

114
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,191
A leather-silhouette puppet show has opened
across the street

115
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,994
Bringing us such good business

116
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,293
It's not luck, this was carefully planned

117
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,518
You're wonderful!

118
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,628
Lp Man, this was specially saved for you

119
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:20,119
I've had six bowls already, I'm so full

120
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,500
Why are you still eating, then?

121
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,763
Go take a walk to help your digestion

122
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:26,141
Tin Chi, business is quite good;

123
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,599
I want to take time off to look around

124
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,942
Fine!

125
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:33,699
Lantern Festival, see if I'll have some... romantic
luck

126
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,847
Alright, I'll stay,

127
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,266
you fellows have a good time

128
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,225
Alright Alright

129
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,448
Come on, let's go!

130
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,483
Wait for me!

131
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:44,363
Mei Wai, you can't just go

132
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,927
Who will cook the dumplings?

133
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll go with you when they return

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,069
No, thanks

135
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,585
Look! Foreigners can play Chinese chess

136
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,695
Chinese can play foreigners' games, too!

137
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,843
If foreigners are capable of learning Chinese
culture,

138
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,872
we can take up Western culture, too

139
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,173
Let's go over there! Let's go

140
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,394
See you later

141
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,849
You surely know what good stuff is

142
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,110
This is the biggest invention of this century: The
gramophone

143
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,102
It can contain your most beautiful voice

144
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,895
Amazing! Even voices can be captured now

145
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,779
This is an English folk song

146
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,813
The story is that King Henry Vlll wrote it

147
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,191
for a girl who rejected his love.

148
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,824
Really? That's amazing! The girl had character

149
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,781
Oh my God! How can I sell this?

150
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:16,316
You scratched my record

151
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:17,390
How am I going to sell it?

152
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,497
I didn't mean it... Well... I'll pay you for it

153
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:23,825
This is very expensive. Do you have the money?

154
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:28,592
All right, boss, I'll buy it from you

155
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:31,008
When the record is scratched, the song won't
play smoothly

156
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,572
Didn't I say I'd pay for it? Is this enough?

157
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,481
May I know your name, please, Miss?

158
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,514
I'll pay you back

159
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,394
Don't worry about it

160
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:46,812
Thank you

161
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,493
Sister!

162
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,867
We don't have a gramophone at home. What did
you buy the record for?

163
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:59,499
I wasn't buying a record, I was buying a feeling

164
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,766
You hit my head with that thing. Pay!

165
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,262
Sorry, Sir! I don't have the money

166
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,643
I don't care

167
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:25,597
You've got to pay me 50 silver dollars

168
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,320
Where will I find 50 silver dollars?

169
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:29,576
No money, eh?

170
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:31,773
Sister!

171
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,461
What are you getting at? Tricking people?

172
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,370
What? Get back! Get up

173
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,218
I clearly saw what happened

174
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,865
The bamboo spinner fell on the ground, it didn't
hit you at all

175
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,051
How dare you meddle with me!

176
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,010
I'm warning you,

177
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,082
if you don't stop right now, I'll alert the police

178
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,808
You need a beating!

179
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,228
No, she doesn't

180
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:50,916
You bums do!

181
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,213
Strike!

182
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,438
To hell with you!

183
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:22,788
Sister!

184
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:42,499
Hold it!

185
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,175
Please spare my life!

186
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,483
Please spare my life!

187
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,741
I'll never do this again, never!

188
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,354
Go!

189
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,802
Thanks for such great help. It's much appreciated

190
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:20,487
Your act of chivalry is greatly admired

191
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,669
Could you leave your name?

192
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,206
Don't worry about it

193
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:28,390
Miss, he's lp Man, and I'm Siu Shan

194
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,694
I'm Yiu Choi

195
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,075
We are from the Wing Chun School

196
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,792
You may call us the Three Wing Chun
Musketeers

197
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,822
Don't forget your record, sis

198
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:42,162
Why bother with other people's business. Are
you hurt?

199
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,962
No, let's go!

200
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,867
Move!

201
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,676
Can I help you?

202
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:08,319
I'm looking for lp Man lp Man?

203
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,317
He's out

204
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,235
If you have something for him, you can leave it
with me

205
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,421
No! I was told to

206
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,646
deliver this letter in person

207
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,334
It's up to you. You can wait if you want

208
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,291
You can also feed the huge mosquitoes

209
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,439
Huge mosquitoes? Wait!

210
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,616
All right!

211
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,500
You must give this letter to lp Man. Thank you!

212
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,418
All right!

213
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:32,912
Thank you

214
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,290
Uncle lp! Mei Wai!

215
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,159
Please go in, lp Man's home

216
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:42,151
Dad! Dad!

217
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,921
What have you brought back?

218
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:46,874
It's Sis' new toy

219
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,391
Be careful! It's very heavy!

220
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:58,540
What's taking him so long to reply?

221
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,187
Hasn't he?

222
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,289
Honestly, did you deliver it in person?

223
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,823
I did!

224
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:09,852
Are you sure? Absolutely!

225
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,707
Keep this medicine with you,

226
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:40,507
it's good for headache, fever, diarrhea, everything

227
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,502
I appreciate it

228
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,343
You'll be on your own studying in Hong Kong,
Man!

229
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,253
Take good care of yourself Yes!

230
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:49,292
So long, Brother Chung So

231
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:52,668
Remember not to waste any time in Hong Kong

232
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,005
Neglect neither your studies nor your martial arts
training;

233
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,923
do not forget our Master's advice

234
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,340
Don't get involved in fights, don't think you're
better than others

235
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,299
Martial arts learning - genuine and authentic;

236
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,719
behavior - proper and discrete; judgement -
objective and rational.

237
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,170
Don't worry!

238
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,460
Good morning Good morning

239
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,069
Good Morning, Reverend

240
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,633
Good morning, class

241
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,734
Practice more at home, understand?

242
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,762
Is lp Man at home, please?

243
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,020
He's gone to Hong Kong. May I know who's
asking for him, please?

244
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,356
It's nothing important. Thank you.

245
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,739
Good morning, Brother Chung So

246
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,266
Good morning Let's eat fried sticks

247
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,910
These fried sticks look very interesting

248
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,097
You are all big eaters, double sticks aren't
enough to feed you

249
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,897
So I made them triple

250
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,043
Let's eat!

251
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:33,787
Why are you people so unhygienic?

252
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,318
You want to know why? Come on!

253
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,006
Do you know now?

254
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,968
Let me help you

255
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:05,626
Don't bother!

256
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:14,220
There you are! How nice!

257
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,601
Chairman Lee Godfather

258
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,209
Thanks for looking after me, Mei Wai

259
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,314
Here's a present for you

260
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,112
How beautiful! Thank you

261
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,027
Tin Chi, you have given tremendous help

262
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,099
ever since you joined the Jing Wu Athletic
Association

263
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,135
Don't mention it

264
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:35,280
Anyway, I have a present for you, too

265
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,661
Thank you, Chairman Lee

266
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:39,078
These were selected from

267
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,300
my jade collection

268
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,835
They seem like a pair

269
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:48,090
Definitely, a pair, like you two

270
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:23,731
I've never seen Chinese pigs playing hockey
before

271
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,225
It's so funny!

272
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,375
Hey, you! Mind your language.

273
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:31,672
My language? It's none of your business

274
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:33,436
I heard you say Chinese pigs

275
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:37,311
Oh, no, no! I'm sorry, I don't mean Chinese pigs

276
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:39,919
I mean... Sick Man of East Asia!

277
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,741
Come on, then!

278
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:51,773
I'll give you three minutes

279
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:54,037
No, two minutes

280
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:56,328
No, one minute

281
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,882
Good!

282
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,980
Just 45 seconds!

283
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:34,809
Take a seat

284
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:39,642
Relax

285
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:44,789
It's OK

286
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:46,247
Your Kung Fu is formidable

287
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:48,276
We call it Wing Chun

288
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,694
What's your friend's name? He's wonderful

289
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,145
His name is...

290
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,811
Good morning, lp Man! Morning

291
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,768
Master lp, morning Say Good morning to him!

292
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:10,875
Morning! Have I met them before?

293
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:14,049
Good morning, lp Man

294
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,351
Not this one, I'm sure

295
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,557
Boss!

296
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:32,549
I'm not the boss here, I'm the manager

297
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:34,007
How can I help?

298
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,534
I need some medicine for a friend

299
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:40,605
What else would you buy in a drug store, kid

300
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,972
Which is better to treat bruises, powder or
ointment?

301
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:47,894
What? He's injured? What happened?

302
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:51,577
A fight? What else?

303
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,486
Who beat him?

304
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,643
I did

305
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,484
I thought he was your friend

306
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:59,824
That's how we became friends

307
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,203
Why did you beat him?

308
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:03,660
Boss, why don't you...

309
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,540
Why don't you bring him here?

310
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,576
Here to receive treatment?

311
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:09,875
Treatment? Bring him here so I can beat him, too

312
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:13,750
Make sure he won't call us 'Chinese pigs' again

313
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,977
Where did you learn about that?

314
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,125
From your friends

315
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,230
You and your name are known to everybody on
this street now, lp Man

316
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,217
You're popular, kid. So, you're studying Wing
Chun?

317
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:29,785
Authentic Wing Chun. The name was inherited
from the school taught by Master Leung Jan from
Foshan

318
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:33,621
So you must be one of Chin's (Nickname of Chan
Wah Shun) disciples

319
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,227
Correct! Authentic my foot.

320
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:40,066
So much so that you made me believe you
learned directly from Master Ng Mui

321
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,329
How long have you studied it?

322
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,439
Finished the lower body strength training yet?

323
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,971
What about 'targeted finger'?

324
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:49,656
You're in Wing Chun, too, boss?

325
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:52,226
First, I told you I'm not the boss;

326
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,298
I'm the manager here

327
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:57,789
Second, I am practicing Wing Chun,

328
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:59,668
but don't know if it's considered authentic

329
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:02,239
Do you want to try it out?

330
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,543
Next time

331
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:05,384
I might be too busy next time

332
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:06,689
If you want to try me, try me now

333
00:29:06,689 --> 00:29:10,218
Better not, if there is any injury...

334
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:13,287
Are you looking down on old folks like me?

335
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:14,235
Come on!

336
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:17,390
Mr Manager!

337
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,977
Hasn' t your master taught you that when
practicing with the others,

338
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,928
you reserve only the strength applied, not the
skill?

339
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:35,076
What, despise me?

340
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:36,680
I mean business then

341
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:44,973
Are you alright, kid?

342
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,316
I'm fine

343
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:48,607
Well, again!

344
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:03,462
Watch my medicine!

345
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,449
Be careful with the Three-Prick Wine

346
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,522
Wait! You call this Wing Chun?

347
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:28,239
Whatever comes from my fist is Wing Chun

348
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:43,168
They are not Wing Chun

349
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:46,234
My Master said Wing Chun strategic movements

350
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,227
30% from the legs, and focus on attacking an
opponent's lower body

351
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:52,106
Your master wasn't wrong

352
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:55,942
The traditional focus is on the use of the hands

353
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:58,513
But that doesn't mean it forbids changes

354
00:30:58,513 --> 00:31:02,195
Changes allow more flexibility

355
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,804
Movements can be adapted in multiple ways,

356
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:08,410
such as leg movements in a form of wrestling,
and they all work

357
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,290
May I know your name, please?

358
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm Leung Bik from Foshan

359
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,006
People call me Sir Bik

360
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:19,682
Master Leung Jan was my father

361
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,367
You're my senior!

362
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:27,361
So is my Wing Chun authentic?

363
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:28,818
You're funny

364
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:32,348
Come back the day after tomorrow, kid

365
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,611
Come here the day after tomorrow?

366
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,337
Don't you want lessons?

367
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:38,025
Of course I do

368
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:41,209
But I can't afford to pay you

369
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,697
Did I ask you to pay?

370
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:02,108
Customs inspection. Open the crates, officers!

371
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:05,567
Hold it!

372
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,776
Inspection is not authorized. The medicine was
purchased from

373
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,811
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the
British Embassy

374
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,653
Mr. Kitano said you can't open this as it was
purchased from

375
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:20,415
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the
British Embassy

376
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:21,941
I don't understand English

377
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,824
How dare a low-ranking customs officer

378
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:30,274
display public contempt for the Japanese
business bureau

379
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,923
Should any damage be incurred, who will be held
responsible?

380
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:33,189
How dare a low-ranking customs officer like you

381
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:36,105
display public contempt for the Japanese
business bureau

382
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:38,061
Should any damage be incurred, who will be held
responsible?

383
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,861
If smuggling is going on, who will be held
responsible, then?

384
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,509
Officers, open the crates!

385
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:44,576
Mr. Kitano said you can't open this

386
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,149
Stop!

387
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,142
What do you think you're doing?

388
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,099
Do you know who this gentleman is?

389
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,936
Do you know how much Mr. Kitano donates to
Foshan every year?

390
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,809
My apologies! Mr. Kitano

391
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:03,495
You may take the goods

392
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,557
What're you standing here for? Clear the way!

393
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,934
Of course I welcome donations

394
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:15,540
But if they are from the Japanese, I will definitely
decline

395
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,842
Why did you make such a comment, Chairman?

396
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:20,029
Japan's evil intentions became apparent

397
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,213
after the Russo-Japanese War, they annexed our
territory...

398
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:24,632
and built the Manchurian Railway,

399
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,627
aiming at economic invasion

400
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,660
Look at what they did in the North-East,

401
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,460
their ambitions are obvious

402
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,069
I think I understand how the Chairman feels

403
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:38,327
But the thing is, the Japanese Chamber of
Commerce in Foshan

404
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:41,473
did not participate in the North-Eastern affair

405
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:44,810
Mr. Kitano came here only to do business,

406
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,035
not much different from other foreign investors

407
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,414
So I think we should treat his donation

408
00:33:49,414 --> 00:33:52,789
the same way as others

409
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:53,825
I don't believe the Japanese

410
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,894
would make a donation without a personal
agenda

411
00:33:56,894 --> 00:34:01,152
Well... after he's done business for so long in
Foshan,

412
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,878
this could probably be his gesture of retuning a
favor

413
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:06,408
Don't be suspicious

414
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,016
You're in business, too, Tin Chi

415
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,858
Why don't you tell us what you think,

416
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,584
as a newcomer?

417
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,308
I tend to agree with what Chairman Lee
suggested

418
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:19,719
After all, our Association is on very sound
financial ground,

419
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,475
and is not urgently in need of donations

420
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,894
Tin Chi, I'm going back to the school

421
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:29,003
See you later

422
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:31,496
Try to talk Chairman Lee

423
00:34:31,496 --> 00:34:33,107
out of being so stubborn, Tin Chi

424
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:35,371
Mr. Mayor, we are all educated people

425
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:37,903
Why should we allow the uneducated

426
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,552
to upset us?

427
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:41,854
You are right

428
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:43,577
Goodbye Take care

429
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:45,717
Bye

430
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,989
The improved version of Wing Chun is the good
use of

431
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:07,863
'distant fist, near elbow, close wrestling,

432
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:10,088
incorporating long and short distance movements'

433
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:13,425
Wing Chun wrestling uses the reverse joint
principle;

434
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,335
no need to hold on to your opponent

435
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,446
Your Master concentrated on

436
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:23,745
the long stretch and low kick

437
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:27,466
My improved version of Wing Chun

438
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:31,302
incorporates the short stretch and high kick

439
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:33,297
Wing Chun should not be described as

440
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,368
'authentic' or 'non-authentic' anymore

441
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:37,286
To me, Wing Chun is one big family,

442
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:40,582
there is no distinction between you, me, and him

443
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,030
Goodbye, Man lp

444
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,792
Our surname goes first, Reverend

445
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,478
lp Man, all the best

446
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:55,163
Same to you, goodbye Goodbye

447
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,341
Let's go

448
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,091
Bye, lp Man! Bye!

449
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:07,896
Goodbye! Bye!

450
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:29,988
Thank you Thank you

451
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:34,023
You should have told me you were coming back,
lp Man

452
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,749
Mei Wai lp Man's back, everybody!

453
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:36,747
You brought back so many things

454
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:37,744
Only this one is mine,

455
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:39,662
the rest are presents for you all

456
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,235
We know lp Man is good to us!

457
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:43,537
Let's go This is for you

458
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,186
For me?

459
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,373
How am I supposed to finish all these toffees

460
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,867
Don't eat them all, some are for my brother to sell

461
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,094
Man! Tin Chi's back!

462
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:52,667
Brother! There you are!

463
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,001
Yes! Long time no see.

464
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,884
You're still stout. Keeping up with martial arts
practice?

465
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,301
Do you want to try me? Sure!

466
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,446
Give it to me

467
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,386
One point for Man

468
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,638
Great! Another point for you, Man!

469
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:35,248
What style is this?

470
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:36,438
Wing Chun!

471
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,164
The high kick doesn't exist in Wing Chun,

472
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:39,046
where did you pick that up?

473
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,337
Try me more first OK

474
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:12,142
Good! One point for Tin Chi

475
00:38:23,814 --> 00:38:25,272
Excellent! Good!

476
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:28,494
Don't tell me this is Wing Chun, Man?

477
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:30,566
This is fantastic. Show me, lp Man

478
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:31,985
It's wonderful! Teach me, too

479
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:34,747
Me, too Me first!

480
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:35,816
One at a time

481
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,181
Mei Wai

482
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,404
Mei Wai, watch out!

483
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:50,821
Is this necessary, Man?

484
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:53,007
I'm all right. Take it easy next time

485
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:54,388
Take a rest, Mei Wai

486
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:55,501
Let's learn it together

487
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,759
To reward your enthusiasm. Come on!

488
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:16,945
Alright?

489
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,019
Amazing!

490
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:19,937
This focuses on the reverse joint principle

491
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,280
It's a different approach like Japanese Judo,

492
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,853
there's no need to hold on to your opponent

493
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:23,888
It's amazing! I want to learn, too

494
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:24,847
Me, too Count me in

495
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,420
Brother Chung So

496
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,530
Brother Chung So

497
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,678
Let me help you

498
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:33,286
Such a fat chicken, let me take care of it

499
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,729
Remember what Master Chan said to you, Man?

500
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:44,949
Time to go home

501
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,667
Let's go!

502
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,703
I ask you

503
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:53,580
Whose style is authentic,

504
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,642
our Master Chan's or Leung Bik's?

505
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,030
Leung Bik?

506
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,214
Brother Chung So, Mr Leung and our Master are
from the same school;

507
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:02,634
his style shouldn't be considered deviant from
authenticity

508
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,357
Also, Leung Bik is Grand Master Leung Jan's
son;

509
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:07,007
he practiced with him since he was a child

510
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,155
But he never got along with the Grand Master,

511
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:12,799
nor with his brothers. Leung Bik is conceited

512
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,945
Perhaps... he held different views

513
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,249
Despite a difference in views,

514
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,433
he shouldn't have created tension in the family

515
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,236
I remember after the Grand Master passed away,

516
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:25,152
Bik's brother immendiately put up a wall...

517
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:28,144
to partition the two families;

518
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:30,983
you can see how badly he was received by the
others

519
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:32,747
He's a bit strange,

520
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:34,742
but we can't assume that his art is not competent

521
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:37,351
People often thought that Wing Chun seldom
uses wrestling moves

522
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,422
But he believes that by applying the targeted
finger style

523
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:41,494
or darting hand movements, opponents can be
overpowered

524
00:40:41,494 --> 00:40:43,450
I've tried it and it's very effective

525
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,931
Comparing Bik's with the tradional moves, his
allow more flexibility

526
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,396
Let me tell you, the Wing Chun Leung Bik has
learned...

527
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:51,430
only accounts for a fraction of his father's

528
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,422
Most of his movements are made up

529
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:58,603
How can one improve without deconstructing the
old?

530
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,406
You are greedy to aspire for more before

531
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:01,979
you can manage the basic Wing Chun principles

532
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,667
You'll end up gaining nothing

533
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,818
I'm fed up. Enjoy your meal

534
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:07,158
Don't get upset, Brother Chung So

535
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:10,224
Man just got back, give him a chance!

536
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:15,406
Fine! He has his chance now

537
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,937
Show me the sort of deviance you've picked up

538
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:20,304
Get up, up!

539
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,648
Brother Chung So! Brother Chung So!

540
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,476
Brother Chung So! Stay away!

541
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:34,352
What happened to the things Leung Bik taught
you?

542
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,999
Brother Chung So! Man!

543
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,304
Lp Man should be feeling sorry by now

544
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:12,564
Brother Chung So, that's enough!

545
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,559
Was it Wing Chun that he just demonstrated?

546
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,590
Does our school have high kick like that?

547
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,313
Or elbow as low as his?

548
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:25,262
Now, I demand you all go on your knees in front
of our master and vow that...

549
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:28,945
you will never again learn anything that deviates
from our school tradition

550
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:32,087
They have nothing to do with this, Brother Chung
So

551
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,464
It was me who wanted to try things out

552
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:38,573
They never said they wanted to learn it from me

553
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:41,334
I'm the only one who deserves punishment for
this

554
00:42:56,412 --> 00:43:00,746
I have taught you all I know, Man

555
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:01,859
Thank you, Master!

556
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,774
Stop calling me master

557
00:43:04,774 --> 00:43:06,386
Why?

558
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:08,304
Your master is Chan Wah Shun;

559
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:11,373
you have to show due respect

560
00:43:11,373 --> 00:43:13,789
When I was young, I was too emotional

561
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:16,053
to try to think from another's perspective

562
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:18,278
And my family was too conservative

563
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:21,845
to accept my innovative ideas,

564
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:25,988
thus causing a lot of misunderstanding and
friction

565
00:43:25,988 --> 00:43:28,520
In order to aviod conflict,

566
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,510
I decided to leave Foshan

567
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:15,897
Master, lp Man is gifted,

568
00:44:15,897 --> 00:44:17,585
but he's such an ungrateful brat

569
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:20,377
Do you think I should expel him?

570
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:27,559
Please give me instruction, Master

571
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,781
If you think I should,

572
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,429
please show 'the head' when I toss the coin

573
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,801
Master, lp Man is young and restless;

574
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,336
he's doomed to make some mistakes

575
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:40,909
And... perhaps it's not entirely his fault

576
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:43,249
I might not be competent enough as an instructor

577
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:45,704
Why don't we do it three times to decide on the
result?

578
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:50,760
Thanks, Master

579
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,094
Thanks, Master, thanks a great deal

580
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:11,061
You are...

581
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:14,091
We heard that your Association has a reputation
for the vision of

582
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:15,933
promoting martial arts on the grounds of
abolishing segregation of schools

583
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:18,043
So we're here to join the Association

584
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:20,114
I'm glad that you share the same vision

585
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,994
How may I address you?

586
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:24,641
Before we enroll, I'd like to see

587
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,943
whether the Association is qualified to teach us

588
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,554
I don't quite understand what you mean

589
00:45:28,554 --> 00:45:30,894
You need to show a sample when you sell goods

590
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,963
So we'd like to check out how competent the
masters are first

591
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:37,223
This is not how our Association operates

592
00:45:37,223 --> 00:45:39,755
Don't make things difficult

593
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:41,942
All right, then. If you don't want to demonstate

594
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,622
we'll be happy to take over

595
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:46,891
You just came to create trouble

596
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,003
Hold it!

597
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:49,454
Wait a minute!

598
00:45:51,302 --> 00:45:53,220
Father

599
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,596
Chairman Kitano,

600
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:58,898
what do you want from us?

601
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:02,350
Not much, I only want to say hello

602
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,803
I don't think so, it's more like picking a fight

603
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:07,798
This is a place to learn martial arts;

604
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,827
I don't see why not!

605
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:19,420
Chairman Lee, allow me

606
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:49,642
Good! Good fight!

607
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,964
Stop! What are you doing?

608
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,531
Good! Good show!

609
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:40,087
Sorry that my daughter isn't as capable

610
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:57,281
Valour is better demonstrated by the young!

611
00:48:03,765 --> 00:48:05,947
Come and have a snack, lp Man

612
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,388
Yours Triple fried sticks

613
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:17,537
Yes! My creation

614
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:19,455
Three-sided. How can one person finish it?

615
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,025
It's for all three of us. We each have one

616
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,943
You two have the crispy sides,

617
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,546
the middle part is not as crunchy

618
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:30,193
The triple stick is what you wanted when you
were a kid

619
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,111
I didn't say that

620
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,451
You really don't remember, eh?

621
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,945
It seemed that I had a sense of humour when I
was a kid

622
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:40,093
Too bad you have none left

623
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:43,693
I won't eat any more Mei Wai...

624
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,988
What have I said wrong?

625
00:48:49,147 --> 00:48:51,099
No! Let's eat

626
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:03,264
Oh yes! I forgot to congratulate you

627
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:04,376
On what?

628
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:07,368
On your successful career in business, young
and hopeful

629
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:10,284
What's more, Chairman Lee will recommend you
for Vice Chairman

630
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,818
a bright future lies ahead of you

631
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:16,537
Stop teasing me. I owe this to Brother Chung
So's leadership

632
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,375
What's your plan after graduation?

633
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,136
I won't keep it from you, but don't laugh at me,
alright?

634
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:26,664
I'd like to start a martial arts school

635
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,467
to promote Wing Chun

636
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,229
What a wonderful idea! If you start in Foshan,

637
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:32,227
I'll come up with the capital for you

638
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:34,874
Not just in Foshan, I want it all over the world

639
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:37,712
I want to show the world how wonderful Wing
Chun is

640
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:39,784
The world? Great!

641
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:41,395
Congratulations to you, Guru of Wing Chun,

642
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,661
who will breed numerous splendid students

643
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:43,883
Thank you!

644
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:47,264
Also, when you become popular,

645
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:49,489
let's make a film

646
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,983
to promote Wing Chun to the whole world

647
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:53,401
You'll contribute the capital, and me, the hard
work

648
00:49:53,517 --> 00:49:55,742
Good! What about profit?

649
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,389
Let's say thirty seventy Fifty fifty!

650
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:00,307
You forty me sixty. Definite!

651
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,612
The congee is getting cold. Eat!

652
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:04,372
Done deal! Let's eat first!

653
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:18,370
Sis!

654
00:50:24,475 --> 00:50:26,201
What?

655
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,963
The mayor's son is here. He wants to ask you out
to a film

656
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:32,186
And Dad has agreed on your behalf

657
00:50:32,186 --> 00:50:33,874
Is that right? Yes!

658
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:35,783
Did he say what film?

659
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:41,162
Do you really want to go? What about lp Man?

660
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:43,004
What about your freedom of romanatic love

661
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,229
Freedom of romantic love?

662
00:50:45,229 --> 00:50:49,178
I've waited so long, but have yet to find my love

663
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:55,386
Perhaps lp Man and I are not connected

664
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,341
Do you really think so?

665
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,371
Or else how could I have done so much but to no
avail

666
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,669
What else can I do about it?

667
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:21,787
Look! A new film is on

668
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,705
I don't think you're a fan of horrors

669
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,048
Let's go have a drink

670
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,043
No! I want to see the film

671
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,995
I'll go get the ticket, then

672
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,718
This way please!

673
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:35,441
Here's your ticket, have a seat.

674
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:42,463
Ip Man?

675
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:45,525
Miss Justice?

676
00:51:45,648 --> 00:51:47,566
Aren't you the daughter of the Deputy Major?

677
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:48,564
How are you?

678
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,520
Hello! Watching this film, too?

679
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,359
Yes, what a small world!

680
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,305
Miss Cheung was looking for you, Man

681
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,144
Really? Anything important?

682
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,547
Let's wait until the end of the film

683
00:52:15,494 --> 00:52:17,181
You're not even afraid of thugs

684
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,516
I thought you're the fearless kind

685
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,854
Of course I'm fearless

686
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:30,685
Don't touch me! What's happening now?

687
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:34,165
Now Dracula is moving towards the female lead

688
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,349
and about to bite her

689
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,262
Is the biting over? He's still biting

690
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,134
Alright, you may open your eyes now

691
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,661
Are you sure?

692
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,003
Yes!

693
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,228
I'm Dracula So am I

694
00:53:13,228 --> 00:53:15,606
Scared the wits out of me. Excuse me

695
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:18,522
Please allow me to take you home, Miss Cheung

696
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:20,440
Don't worry about it, Mr. Cho, bye!

697
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,782
Come on... Miss Cheung, when will we...

698
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,780
Three yams, please!

699
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,580
Thanks for taking me to the film, thank you very
much.

700
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,184
See you Bye!

701
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,411
Buying yams?

702
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:34,595
Where did you pick up your Englsih, Miss
Cheung?

703
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:35,976
I learned it myself

704
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,048
My brother took Englsih lessons in Hong Kong,
too

705
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,582
Perhaps you two can get together

706
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:41,033
and practise speaking it

707
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,840
Where are we heading now?

708
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,641
Tomorrow will be our Master's birthday, we'll go
buy a chicken

709
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,595
OK Let's leave, Mei Wai

710
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:51,513
We don't speak English, neither do you!

711
00:53:51,513 --> 00:53:52,810
Let's go

712
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:59,223
Didn't you say you had something to ask me?

713
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:00,911
No need now

714
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:03,136
You're amusing,

715
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:06,013
yet I have a question to ask you

716
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:07,931
Please do

717
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:09,687
I've not got your name

718
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:14,913
Didn't you address me as Miss Justice?

719
00:54:14,913 --> 00:54:17,100
I like it

720
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,358
You're not going to tell me

721
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:24,186
My name is Cheung Wing Shing

722
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:28,110
The feeling of thinking of a person,

723
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,181
whose name is not known,

724
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:32,790
is like listening to a song

725
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,473
without knowing the title

726
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:39,503
Or you know the person's name,

727
00:54:39,503 --> 00:54:42,112
but not what he's thinking about

728
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,835
The feeling is like listening to a song,

729
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:46,897
when the title is familiar but not the tune

730
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:54,381
One, two, three, four

731
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,185
Is it hurting you?

732
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,986
It's not nice to me. Beat it up

733
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:02,556
Watch me!

734
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:07,315
Like this, one, two

735
00:55:07,315 --> 00:55:10,154
So slow, speed it up,

736
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:14,105
come on, come on

737
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:16,439
Don't laugh, laughing drains energy

738
00:55:22,468 --> 00:55:27,493
Look at you, being around this log all day long

739
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:31,291
You've grown to be loglike,

740
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,167
hopelessly inarticulate

741
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:37,039
How can I be more expressive, then?

742
00:55:38,426 --> 00:55:42,032
You can exercise your thoughts, for instance...

743
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:45,715
Think of something you like

744
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:47,242
or somebody you want to be with

745
00:55:48,938 --> 00:55:50,664
Well, I'll stick your name here, then,

746
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:52,198
Cheung... Wing... Shing

747
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:53,925
So you want to beat me up every day?

748
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,687
No, no, no! I just want to be with you

749
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,720
lp Man! Go and help prepare dinner

750
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,705
I'm taking Wing Shing out for dinner

751
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:08,809
Come over here, Wing Shing, I have something
to tell you

752
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:10,260
Go clean the study Yes, Sir!

753
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:16,018
What do you want to tell me, Dad?

754
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,008
You've made a major mistake, Wing Shing

755
00:56:21,008 --> 00:56:22,535
What major mistake?

756
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:27,568
The worst I could think of was giving the Mayor's
son the cold shoulder

757
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:29,984
You shouldn't have gone out with that martial arts
guy, lp Man

758
00:56:29,984 --> 00:56:31,327
If you loathe martial arts guys so much,

759
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:33,360
why do you support the Jing Wu Athletic
Association, then?

760
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,084
I support them because my job requires it

761
00:56:36,084 --> 00:56:37,964
Our freidnship is not based on a job

762
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:39,613
I'm not a hypocrite like you

763
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:42,337
Me a hypocrite? I'm your dad

764
00:56:42,337 --> 00:56:44,293
why won't you listen to me?

765
00:56:44,293 --> 00:56:46,557
I'm just worried that you make friends who are a
bad influence

766
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,050
and bring disgrace on the family

767
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,039
Unless you don't care much about our family,

768
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:56,790
go back to your room and reflect

769
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:05,124
For you Thank you

770
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:07,186
I'm sure it'll bring a lot of sweet dreams

771
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:12,336
I'm afraid that we might have to stop seeing each
other

772
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:13,677
What happened?

773
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:18,013
I'm here to see Deputy Mayor Cheung

774
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:19,311
Please come in!

775
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:28,168
Please take a seat, Sir

776
00:57:30,788 --> 00:57:33,505
OK, it's done

777
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,877
I hope to see you soon, Mr. Cheung

778
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,186
The pleasure was all mine

779
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:41,790
See you soon

780
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:46,662
By the way, where can I purchase bone china?

781
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:51,656
He wants to find out where he can purchase
some Chinese bones

782
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,267
Chinese bones?

783
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,723
The British simply adore bone china

784
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:59,329
The British have developed a taste for Chinese
bones

785
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:01,391
I think he can get a better price from the
slaughter house

786
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:06,541
Go to the Killing Animal House to buy some

787
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,152
Killing Animal?

788
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,257
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Kill, kill, kill

789
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,673
In that place they kill chickens, kill cows,

790
00:58:14,673 --> 00:58:16,703
kill pigs, kill ducks, kill geese...

791
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:19,622
Good. Thank you OK!

792
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,425
Sir!

793
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:25,178
The British would like to buy bone China

794
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:31,548
He wants bone china!

795
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:35,657
Just kidding

796
00:58:35,657 --> 00:58:40,452
Mr. Cheung says he can take you to buy very
good china bone

797
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:41,795
Just kidding

798
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:43,981
Thanks for doing the favor for me

799
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:45,629
Goodbye Goodbye

800
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:56,833
Your English is not bad, young man

801
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,940
Your name? Lp Man

802
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,664
So you're lp Man, here for Wing Shing?

803
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,541
I'm here to pay a special visit to Mr. Deputy
Mayor

804
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,112
Pay me a visit?

805
00:59:08,073 --> 00:59:10,720
Something's happening, sis!

806
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,985
What are you fussing about?

807
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:15,131
Lp Man's here lp Man's here?

808
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,815
He came to see Dad. I don't know what they're
up to. Come and see

809
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:49,531
Let me help you! No, thanks!

810
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:56,293
Let's go to a movie tonight

811
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,250
What about the others?

812
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,730
Siu Shan and Yiu Choi don't like dramas

813
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:03,992
What about lp Man?

814
01:00:04,963 --> 01:00:08,684
Lp Man... has company

815
01:00:08,684 --> 01:00:10,789
Let me think about it

816
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:24,980
Don't think for too long. The movie will be off soon

817
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:30,434
When do you want to go, then?

818
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,964
Actually, I've already got two tickets

819
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,764
Too bad I couldn't get toffee,

820
01:00:37,992 --> 01:00:39,519
only some chocolates

821
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:23,719
Good day, Master Ng. This is a present from Mr.
Chan

822
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:26,788
Thank you, Yiu Choi! Yes!

823
01:01:26,788 --> 01:01:29,473
Take the presents to the main hall

824
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:30,701
This way, please! Thank you!

825
01:01:30,701 --> 01:01:34,115
Look at these paper cuts, Man

826
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:37,146
Thanks for your trouble Thank you!

827
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:38,597
Lay it out properly

828
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:42,823
Hey, move the left lantern more to the left

829
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:44,319
All right!

830
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,544
Move the right lantern more to the right

831
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:47,503
Finished?

832
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,728
Is my writing all right?

833
01:01:49,728 --> 01:01:51,762
Tin Chi! Lp Man!

834
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:54,447
Put these couplets on the front door

835
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:55,598
Alright!

836
01:01:55,598 --> 01:01:58,552
I'll get the rice paste, be back soon

837
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,893
Hurry!

838
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,431
Mr. Ip Tin Chi

839
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:15,968
Can I help you?

840
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:18,231
The Kitanos asked me

841
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:21,031
to deliver a gift on your big day

842
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,712
Happy wedding day!

843
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,687
I really want to know how you feel now

844
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,879
Thank you all! Cheers!

845
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:06,260
Hope you have beautiful kids

846
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,322
I appreciate it Congratulations!

847
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,625
Please take a seat!

848
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,729
Mr. Ip, please sit down! Thanks

849
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,760
What a great evening!

850
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,021
Tin Chi's got himself a wife and I've got a
daughter

851
01:03:39,021 --> 01:03:42,281
I'm very happy, too. To me, Mei Wai is like half a
daughter

852
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,890
while Tin Chi is half a son

853
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,153
Now half a daughter is marrying half a son;

854
01:03:47,153 --> 01:03:48,649
half a son is marrying half a daughter

855
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:51,104
The two halves together form a perfect couple

856
01:03:51,104 --> 01:03:54,941
Don't forget that Tin Chi is my whole son

857
01:03:54,941 --> 01:03:56,360
I'm most thrilled to see him

858
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,432
marrying your half daughter

859
01:03:58,432 --> 01:04:00,772
You'll have another happy occasion very soon

860
01:04:00,772 --> 01:04:03,687
I believe it'll be lp Man's turn soon

861
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:05,375
Keep up the good work, Man!

862
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,904
Tin Chi, have a wonderful wedding night!

863
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:10,515
Thanks! Congratulations on your promotion

864
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:12,510
to the Deputy Chairmanship, too. Cheers!

865
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,505
Thank you! Why don't we fill up the glasses?

866
01:04:14,505 --> 01:04:16,308
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

867
01:04:16,308 --> 01:04:18,341
Bottoms up! Tin Chi, work hard!

868
01:04:18,341 --> 01:04:21,516
I know, Dad. Cheers!

869
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,085
To my woman

870
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:29,918
To my man

871
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,551
Cheers again! Great!

872
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:44,503
Come on!

873
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:47,880
Master!

874
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,094
He was very happy and is a bit tipsy

875
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:55,744
Stay here tonight, Man

876
01:04:55,744 --> 01:04:58,813
Go to sleep, go!

877
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:00,616
Yes, Sir!

878
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:02,187
Watch your step Man

879
01:05:04,644 --> 01:05:07,367
Let's fill our glasses again

880
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,324
It's getting late, President Lee

881
01:05:09,324 --> 01:05:10,589
What do you mean by late?

882
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:17,993
The night is still young

883
01:05:17,993 --> 01:05:20,564
Tin Chi said your martial arts skill is superb

884
01:05:20,564 --> 01:05:22,904
Come on! Show me your skills

885
01:05:22,904 --> 01:05:24,131
Next time!

886
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:27,085
Why next time? Let's do it tonight

887
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:28,159
President Lee, seriously, it's getting late!

888
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,189
Let's not start late, then

889
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:35,290
President Lee!

890
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:38,172
Sir!

891
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,090
We don't need you here. Retire to your room

892
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,661
Let's try again President Lee!

893
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:07,896
Let's go! Yes, Sir

894
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:12,078
Sit tight, off we go!

895
01:06:30,804 --> 01:06:33,374
Master Ng, Master lp,

896
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:34,947
where's Tin Chi? Isn't he coming?

897
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,366
It was his wedding night last night

898
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:37,632
I'll tell him later

899
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:38,810
Let's go in first

900
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:42,840
Master This way

901
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:53,821
I can't imagine the honorable and respected

902
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:55,470
President ended up with such a tragic death

903
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,079
We must locate the murderer,

904
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,109
the President cannot die in vain

905
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:02,414
Show me in

906
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:03,565
Have you reported to the police?

907
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,368
Not yet We'd better report it first

908
01:07:05,368 --> 01:07:07,277
Right away Got it!

909
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,300
Where's my brother? In his room

910
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:33,179
lp Tin Chi!

911
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,359
Lp Tin Chi!

912
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:40,085
Lp Tin Chi, come with me

913
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:43,384
What's wrong? You stay here

914
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:45,413
You come with me right now; I have to talk to you

915
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:51,478
What's the matter?

916
01:07:51,478 --> 01:07:53,396
People should have qualms of conscience

917
01:07:53,396 --> 01:07:55,161
What're you getting at?

918
01:07:55,161 --> 01:07:58,115
Didn't Lee Man Ho treat you like his son?

919
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,225
Why did you do that?

920
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:01,402
What've I done?

921
01:08:06,094 --> 01:08:07,130
Are you out of your mind?

922
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,204
Stop acting innocent!

923
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:09,777
Strangle me if you have the balls

924
01:08:09,777 --> 01:08:10,774
I have no clue what you're talking about

925
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:13,575
You strangled President Lee, only you used left
hand

926
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:14,840
Lee is dead?

927
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,490
I won't let him die in vain!

928
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,331
Let go of him, Man!

929
01:08:18,331 --> 01:08:20,288
What are you two doing? Why start a fight?

930
01:08:20,288 --> 01:08:21,899
Your Godfather was killed

931
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,233
Look this man in the eyes. He is the killer

932
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:27,346
All because he was strangled with the left hand,

933
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:29,034
you're accusing me of murder

934
01:08:29,034 --> 01:08:31,183
I'm not the only one in Foshan who's learned the
strangling move

935
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:32,679
You taught me this move

936
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:33,906
You know how to strangle with your left hand,
too.

937
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,632
The Japanese want to get rid of their opponents

938
01:08:35,632 --> 01:08:37,090
You must be the one who helped them

939
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,967
Tell me, why did the Japanese send gifts to your
wedding?

940
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,578
I do business with many foreigners

941
01:08:41,578 --> 01:08:44,341
It's no surprise that the Japanese would send me
presents

942
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:47,407
Swear that you have nothing to do with President
Lee's murder

943
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:53,394
All right! I, lp Tin Chi swear...

944
01:08:53,394 --> 01:08:56,463
Tin Chi, the police are here

945
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:58,372
lp Man, have you reported to the police?

946
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,296
Mr. Ip Tin Chi,

947
01:09:01,296 --> 01:09:03,560
we are here to take Mr. Ip Man to the police
station

948
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,979
Why are you taking my brother away?

949
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:08,163
He's suspected of President Lee's murder

950
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:09,582
Lee's servant witnessed a fight

951
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:13,495
and heated argument between lp Man and Lee
last night

952
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:15,068
The President was quite drunk

953
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,411
and my brother just escorted him home

954
01:09:16,411 --> 01:09:17,485
No need to start a fight with President Lee

955
01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:20,170
after taking him home, right?

956
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,319
Arrest him

957
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:22,971
You're not taking lp Man away

958
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:24,927
There must be some understanding here My
brother doesn't kill

959
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:28,648
Mr. Ip, please stop your wife from obstructing our
course of action

960
01:09:28,648 --> 01:09:30,298
I'll go with them

961
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:32,753
I fear not as I'm innocent

962
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:34,171
Go!

963
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:39,351
Lp Tin Chi, remember you swore an oath

964
01:09:57,228 --> 01:10:01,140
Inspector, if you don't have enough evidence to
press charges

965
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,250
you have to release him

966
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,202
Deputy Mayor, lp Man has been charged with
felony

967
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,196
We need more time to investigate

968
01:10:09,196 --> 01:10:11,421
lp Man is innocent, you can't lock him up.

969
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:15,680
Miss Cheung, we go by evidence;

970
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,020
we don't bring charges against innocent citizens

971
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,705
There are witnesses in this case

972
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:24,733
If he's innocent,

973
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:26,958
why won't he try to defend himself?

974
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:31,484
You keep saying lp Man is innocent;

975
01:10:31,484 --> 01:10:32,827
do you have evidence, Miss Cheung?

976
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:35,238
Unless you can prove his innocence, stop making
these empty claims

977
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:10,613
lp Tin Chi has been elected

978
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:12,762
President of the Jing Wu Athletic Association

979
01:11:12,762 --> 01:11:15,217
Good! Congratulations!

980
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:19,628
Congratulations! Thank you!

981
01:11:19,628 --> 01:11:21,733
Congratulations! Thank you!

982
01:11:49,474 --> 01:11:51,890
Mr. Kitano will donate $300,000

983
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,156
to the Association

984
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:58,258
And will send his students here to exchange
knowledge.

985
01:11:58,258 --> 01:11:59,600
Any objections?

986
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:52,692
Lee Man Ho... killers in ambush

987
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:00,596
You can leave now!

988
01:13:00,596 --> 01:13:02,396
How come?

989
01:13:03,205 --> 01:13:04,546
Let's get out of here first

990
01:13:06,274 --> 01:13:07,386
Come on!

991
01:13:07,386 --> 01:13:09,227
At 10:30 pm, the night of the murder,

992
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:11,069
lp Man came to my place

993
01:13:11,069 --> 01:13:13,716
We stayed up and chatted

994
01:13:13,716 --> 01:13:19,432
He was drunk and so spent the night in my room

995
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:22,654
Miss Cheung, are you telling the truth?

996
01:13:22,654 --> 01:13:26,797
Were you really with lp Man on the night of the
murder?

997
01:13:26,797 --> 01:13:29,521
Your testimony is critical to the case

998
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,707
If you're making things up,

999
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,355
you could be arrested

1000
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:39,610
I swear the truth in my capacity as the Deputy
Mayor's daughter

1001
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,950
However, I can't simply take your alibi

1002
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,827
and believe that lp Man is innocent

1003
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:47,551
I need more supporting evidence

1004
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,814
More supporting evidence?

1005
01:13:49,814 --> 01:13:53,919
Is my daughter's chastity not enough

1006
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,566
to prove his innocence?

1007
01:13:57,064 --> 01:14:00,900
I guess I need the Provincial Governor

1008
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,624
to come and do justice

1009
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:08,803
Dad, don't be too upset

1010
01:14:08,803 --> 01:14:11,105
I had no alternative but to make up such a lie

1011
01:14:11,105 --> 01:14:12,793
I'm so sorry

1012
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:14,672
You sacrificed your reputation

1013
01:14:14,672 --> 01:14:16,552
to rescue him;

1014
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,314
just to rescue a Kung Fu guy!

1015
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:20,542
You must marry my sister as soon as you can!

1016
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:22,421
Dad, don't get mad! Wing Shing!

1017
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:25,529
Sorry! I'm not worth it

1018
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:27,558
Worth it or not is only for me to decide

1019
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:32,968
I don't want you to marry me because of this

1020
01:14:34,735 --> 01:14:36,110
Wing Shing!

1021
01:14:38,303 --> 01:14:42,369
That's not what I mean, I want you to marry me

1022
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,403
I'll take you as my wife with an official ceremony
and a grand wedding.

1023
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:45,973
Your father need not worry

1024
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,806
Mei Wai! Mei Wai!

1025
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,971
Mei Wai, why are you doing this?

1026
01:15:31,971 --> 01:15:35,113
Did you kill my Godfather, Tin Chi?

1027
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:38,953
Do you work for the Japanese?

1028
01:15:38,953 --> 01:15:41,676
Did you betray your own people for money, or for
power?

1029
01:15:41,676 --> 01:15:43,940
It's not as simple as you think

1030
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,892
It's hard to explain

1031
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:48,773
Mei Wai, please don't leave me!

1032
01:15:48,773 --> 01:15:50,806
Listen to me

1033
01:15:50,806 --> 01:15:53,108
I beg you. Please listen!

1034
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:56,254
What other lies do you want to tell me?

1035
01:15:56,254 --> 01:16:00,203
You can't die, you'll be a mother soon

1036
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:07,801
But you've killed, you should give yourself in

1037
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:10,371
It won't work! It won't work!

1038
01:16:10,371 --> 01:16:12,251
Listen!

1039
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:14,968
We should go somewhere we belong

1040
01:16:23,222 --> 01:16:24,400
Where's the letter?

1041
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,122
Who came?

1042
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:31,930
Tell me, who came?

1043
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,541
No... Nobody

1044
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:36,563
Tell me who was here?

1045
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:41,050
Brother Chung So... he came to see me just now

1046
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:45,203
I've caused my brother enough damage,

1047
01:16:45,203 --> 01:16:47,385
I don't want to involve Brother Chung So

1048
01:17:10,483 --> 01:17:13,361
Where are you heading?

1049
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:15,662
I've done so much for your career advancement

1050
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:17,734
Dad even made lp Man the culprit for your crime

1051
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:20,419
And you back out because of this lowly woman!

1052
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:24,524
I've done what you told me. What more do you
want from me?

1053
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:28,091
Kill Ng Chung So; he's aware that you're working
for us

1054
01:17:28,091 --> 01:17:31,889
For you, and for us,

1055
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:36,876
whoever gets in the way should be eliminated

1056
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:39,523
I don't want to kill any more!

1057
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:40,942
This is not an option!

1058
01:18:05,993 --> 01:18:08,141
Tin Chi! Don't hurt her!

1059
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,829
Tin Chi!

1060
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:11,747
I gave you my word on the honor of a samurai:

1061
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:15,353
You'll be free to leave after this mission

1062
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:17,309
Don't say that you haven't been given a second
chance!

1063
01:18:17,309 --> 01:18:18,268
How can I overcome him?

1064
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:20,178
If you can't do this alone, we'll form a brother and
sister team

1065
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:31,081
Tin Chi, come out!

1066
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,114
Tin Chi, come out quick!

1067
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:36,222
We don't spare traitors in the Wing Chun Martial
Arts School

1068
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:37,679
He's no longer your senior

1069
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,665
Get him out here, now!

1070
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:53,828
Tin Chi! Tin Chi!

1071
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:08,369
I beg your forgiveness, Master

1072
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,471
I've failed as a teacher and a leader

1073
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,349
Yiu Choi! Yiu Choi!

1074
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,575
Master!

1075
01:21:23,555 --> 01:21:26,043
Lp Tin Chi, you traitor!

1076
01:21:52,633 --> 01:21:54,237
That's no way to treat your fellow disciples

1077
01:21:56,316 --> 01:21:58,804
Watch out, Man! I will!

1078
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,917
Kill him!

1079
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:31,260
Clear the way!

1080
01:26:08,735 --> 01:26:10,615
I beat you up, not in revenge for being framed

1081
01:26:10,615 --> 01:26:11,651
But to defend Lee Man Ho,

1082
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:13,799
the Master, and Dad's reputation

1083
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:15,141
Why did you turn traitor

1084
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:16,516
when you were so loved and respected by us?

1085
01:26:17,788 --> 01:26:19,283
I'm not a traitor!

1086
01:26:20,282 --> 01:26:24,766
I'm a Japanese sergeant, Tanaka Eiketsu

1087
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:28,371
I left my parents when I was twelve

1088
01:26:29,796 --> 01:26:32,711
to become a spy in China

1089
01:26:32,711 --> 01:26:35,051
I miss my country,

1090
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:36,655
I want to go home

1091
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:42,954
I couldn't even see my mother

1092
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:45,140
when she died

1093
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:49,777
I have yet to be able to pay my respects at her
grave

1094
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:59,219
It might not be a bad idea to die now,

1095
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:01,128
so everything can be ended

1096
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:08,348
I'm a soldier, which leaves me no choice

1097
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,718
I'm relieved now

1098
01:27:13,988 --> 01:27:16,018
as I've finally carried out my mission

1099
01:27:18,055 --> 01:27:21,775
I don't need to hurt the people I love any more

1100
01:27:23,348 --> 01:27:25,072
It's been a pleasure to be adopted by the lp
family

1101
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:30,673
and be your brother

1102
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,350
I have no regrets,

1103
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:40,036
as Mei Wai has been my wife

1104
01:27:40,036 --> 01:27:41,562
Where's Mei Wai now?

1105
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:21,694
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's
shadow, not his hand.

1106
01:29:21,694 --> 01:29:23,527
Focus on what you feel rather than what you see

1107
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:34,809
Where's Tin Chi?

1108
01:30:39,108 --> 01:30:43,363
I feel guilty; I wasn't able to keep his son

1109
01:31:06,268 --> 01:31:07,840
Captain, these crates have just arrived

1110
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,915
They are all Kitano's

1111
01:31:08,915 --> 01:31:11,522
Open them for inspection!

1112
01:31:21,804 --> 01:31:25,564
Where am I? Who are you?

1113
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:27,367
I want to go home

1114
01:31:27,367 --> 01:31:28,556
There's one over here, too!

1115
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:30,661
Over here, too! Help him out

1116
01:31:31,701 --> 01:31:33,198
Any water? Give them some!

1117
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:34,343
Will do!

1118
01:31:44,706 --> 01:31:46,624
Easy, get him out!

1119
01:31:46,624 --> 01:31:50,301
Dad, a beggar is unconscious outside

1120
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,560
Don't be afraid! Leave!

1121
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,207
Give them some water!

1122
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:15,510
At the critical moment,

1123
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:18,694
he arrived in a hurry with a long rod in hand,

1124
01:32:18,694 --> 01:32:22,722
beating the hell out of the Japanese with

1125
01:32:22,722 --> 01:32:26,367
the authentic Wing Chun 'half-past six' rod style

1126
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:28,400
However, his rod was slashed into two halves

1127
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,929
by your Uncle Tin Chi's Japanese sword

1128
01:32:31,929 --> 01:32:34,001
Yet Tin Chi didn't let go,

1129
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:36,456
he pressed even harder...

1130
01:32:36,456 --> 01:32:40,864
by attacking lp Man with Karate and Judo

1131
01:32:44,013 --> 01:32:46,276
How did my Dad react?

1132
01:32:46,276 --> 01:32:48,425
He was very alert;

1133
01:32:48,425 --> 01:32:50,381
he immediately used the two half rods

1134
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:51,992
like a pair of wing-shaped swords,

1135
01:32:51,992 --> 01:32:53,757
and brandished them frantically,

1136
01:32:53,757 --> 01:32:57,133
at times mixing in some unknown styles,

1137
01:32:57,133 --> 01:32:59,703
styles difficult to identify, to beat his opponent

1138
01:32:59,703 --> 01:33:02,427
These mixed movements, regardless of their
authenticity,

1139
01:33:02,427 --> 01:33:04,613
were not only powerful enough to win,

1140
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:07,414
but also good enough to save my life

1141
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:09,140
From then on, I stopped believing that martial
arts schools

1142
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,250
should be segregated to maintain their own
authentic styles

1143
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,436
My eyes were opened and saw a broader horizon

1144
01:33:13,436 --> 01:33:16,390
I don't understand how Uncle Tin Chi picked up
Japanese Kung Fu

1145
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,810
Yeah! Why? Why?

1146
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:19,497
As a matter of fact, your Uncle Tin Chi...

1147
01:33:19,497 --> 01:33:21,646
Why stop practicing? Dad!

1148
01:33:21,646 --> 01:33:23,947
Go and do more training and practice. Hurry!
Hurry!

1149
01:33:23,947 --> 01:33:26,556
Let's go and practice!

1150
01:33:26,556 --> 01:33:27,860
Telling stories again, Brother Chung So?

1151
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,318
You've gone over them thousands of times

1152
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:32,579
The thing is, every time it's a new story to them

1153
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:36,031
You're right! Children should know about their
past

1154
01:33:36,031 --> 01:33:39,062
Pay full attention when you practice. You are not
allowed to eat before you're done

1155
01:33:39,062 --> 01:33:40,596
Dinner's ready, Jun! Stop the training

1156
01:33:40,596 --> 01:33:43,320
Come and eat, everybody!

1157
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:47,501
Dad says I have to practise well before I can eat

1158
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:52,066
What's more important? Martial Arts or food?

1159
01:33:52,066 --> 01:33:53,639
Food! Dad!

1160
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:55,327
All right! Take a good rest

1161
01:33:55,327 --> 01:33:57,437
Practise more after you eat

1162
01:33:57,437 --> 01:33:59,848
Eat!
