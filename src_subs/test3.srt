1
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:47,155
Cancel the Twenty-one Demands!

2
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:52,250
Give back Qingdao! We swear on our lives!

3
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,277
Democracy.

4
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,193
Science.

5
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:54,209
Wing Chun Martial Arts School

6
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,676
Mr. Ip Master Chan

7
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,897
Please come in OK

8
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,586
Finish the lesson for me

9
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:13,883
Yes, Master. How are you, Mr. Ip?

10
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,800
Girl's stuff, no substance

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,373
Watch your mouth, Man!

12
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,904
Master Ng Mui created this Wing Chun fist style,

13
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,853
the secret is the control of power with flexibility

14
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,698
It's my honour and pleasure to see

15
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,002
this fine class of disciples you have, Master Chan

16
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,802
Mr. Ip, I've heard that you're travelling between
Hong Kong and Foshan

17
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,107
Business must be doing well, then

18
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,792
Oh, before I forget, I must pay you the rent

19
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,554
No hurry, no hurry. We're good friends!

20
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,549
You rent Mulberry Garden to me at such a low
rent;

21
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,659
I have not yet found an opportunity

22
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,421
Seriously, it won't be hard to pay back the favor,
if you wish

23
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,795
Man!

24
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:50,328
Yes, Dad!

25
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:54,285
This is my youngest son, lp Man,

26
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,088
my own flesh and blood

27
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,921
Tin Chi! Dad!

28
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,341
This is my adopted son who has been with us for
a year now,

29
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,297
Tin Chi

30
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,673
The purpose of my trip here today is to get them
a superb master

31
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,016
A master?

32
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,616
Yes! They both have a passion for Kung Fu

33
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,835
Please accept this tea to show my commitment,
Master

34
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,354
Please accept the tea, Master

35
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,792
As members of our school,

36
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,634
you two must observe the guiding principles

37
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,130
Martial arts learning - genuine and authentic;

38
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,048
behavior - proper and discrete;

39
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,199
judgement - objective and rational

40
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,037
Understood, Master

41
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,413
Didn't you say that you love Kung Fu, Man?

42
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,255
Many other disciples will keep you company.

43
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,518
I have to go to Hong Kong on business

44
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:55,387
Dad, take good care of yourself!

45
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,801
Make sure you look after your little brother, Tin
Chi

46
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,168
Dad, I will, I promise

47
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,627
Dad!

48
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,391
Time to take the medicine, Master

49
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,071
Leave it there!

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,787
Remember! All hand movements are clearly
directed by the intention in mind;

51
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,853
if your intention is justified, you're on the right
track

52
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:42,923
Master, the medicine is getting cold

53
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,511
You have shown improvement

54
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:32,984
Remember! The noble mind commands authentic
style- movements,

55
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,670
which allow stability when you defend, and
invincibility when you attack

56
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,624
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's
shadow, not his hand.

57
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:41,577
Focus on what you feel rather than what you see.
Understand?

58
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,683
Yes, Master

59
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,789
Maintain world peace;

60
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,934
establish the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity
Sphere

61
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,543
You are the hope of our Empire,

62
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,461
Japan's future rests with you

63
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:16,602
Dad...

64
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,049
Tin Chi, wake up! Are you having a bad dream?

65
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:23,238
What... were... you saying?

66
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,871
Are you hungry? In fact, I'm hungry, too

67
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,778
There's nothing to eat at all

68
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:54,733
Look! Two huge rats coming out to find
something to eat!

69
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,265
You'll be dead if the master finds out

70
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,221
Not him, it's me

71
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:02,214
It's... me... not him

72
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,093
Hush!

73
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,932
Since you gave me a toffee,

74
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,350
I'll help you out!

75
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,799
This is for you

76
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,909
Why do fried double-sticks only come in pairs?

77
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,516
How nice if there were three pieces

78
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,654
Drink this one, Master

79
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,258
This bowl is freshly made

80
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:45,754
You're so busy

81
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,893
The medicine won't be as effective if it's reheated

82
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:53,119
Chung So, you are dedicated and dutiful,

83
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,071
I'll be happy to see you inherit this school

84
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,715
Man is gifted in martial arts

85
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:04,392
Give him the best after I'm gone.

86
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,762
Yes!

87
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:10,994
Go watch them!

88
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:26,571
Master! Master!

89
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,752
Stay away, stay clear.

90
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:47,046
Have a smooth voyage, Master! Give us your
blessing

91
00:09:57,452 --> 00:10:00,828
The sun is setting, clear of obstruction and ill luck

92
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,780
Raise the casket

93
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,186
Lower the casket

94
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:25,302
This is my promise and my oath to Master Wah
Shun:

95
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:28,371
I, Chung So, will exert all energy, with all my
might,

96
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:31,852
to make authentic Wing Chun prosper for as long
as I live

97
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,811
1, 2, 3, 4

98
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,803
palms up, strike, withdraw, reach out, strike

99
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:42,640
1, 2, 3, 4, palms up, strike

100
00:10:51,311 --> 00:11:07,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

101
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,800
Withdraw

102
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,174
All right! That's it for the day.

103
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,705
Go home

104
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,379
Tin Chi, you were quite good today

105
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,949
Take a rest, Man!

106
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,366
Hey! Listen to Brother Chung So. Let's eat!

107
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,747
Mei Wai, let me help you set the table

108
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:31,892
Good!

109
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,998
Rest! Dinner's ready

110
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,295
All right!

111
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,858
Spend the Lantern Festival with sweets

112
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,275
Enjoy sweet dumplings together

113
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,040
Tin Chi, how lucky we are!

114
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,191
A leather-silhouette puppet show has opened
across the street

115
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,994
Bringing us such good business

116
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,293
It's not luck, this was carefully planned

117
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,518
You're wonderful!

118
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,628
Lp Man, this was specially saved for you

119
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:20,119
I've had six bowls already, I'm so full

120
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,500
Why are you still eating, then?

121
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,763
Go take a walk to help your digestion

122
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:26,141
Tin Chi, business is quite good;

123
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,599
I want to take time off to look around

124
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,942
Fine!

125
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:33,699
Lantern Festival, see if I'll have some... romantic
luck

126
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,847
Alright, I'll stay,

127
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,266
you fellows have a good time

128
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,225
Alright Alright

129
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,448
Come on, let's go!

130
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,483
Wait for me!

131
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:44,363
Mei Wai, you can't just go

132
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,927
Who will cook the dumplings?

133
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll go with you when they return

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,069
No, thanks

135
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,585
Look! Foreigners can play Chinese chess

136
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,695
Chinese can play foreigners' games, too!

137
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,843
If foreigners are capable of learning Chinese
culture,

138
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,872
we can take up Western culture, too

139
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,173
Let's go over there! Let's go

140
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,394
See you later

141
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,849
You surely know what good stuff is

142
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,110
This is the biggest invention of this century: The
gramophone

143
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,102
It can contain your most beautiful voice

144
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,895
Amazing! Even voices can be captured now

145
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,779
This is an English folk song

146
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,813
The story is that King Henry Vlll wrote it

147
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,191
for a girl who rejected his love.

148
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,824
Really? That's amazing! The girl had character

149
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,781
Oh my God! How can I sell this?

150
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:16,316
You scratched my record
